## Subjects

1. Write a program that calculates the square root of a number with Babylon method.
2. Write a program to check if an integer is prime.
3. Write a program to find the greatest common divisor of two integers by prime factorization.
4. Write a program to find the greatest common divisor of two integers by Euclidean algorithm.
5. Write a program that will calculate lowest common multiple of two integers by factorization.
6. Implement insertion sort that will sort n integers in increasing order.
7. Write a program that adds two n-bit binary numbers, stored in two arrays of size n.
8. Write a program that finds the maximum element in an array of size n. Analyse the running time.
9. Use the maximum finding algorithm to implement an algorithm that sorts the given array of integers in non-increasing order.(selection sort)
10. Implement merge sort that will sort n integers in increasing order.
11. Implement recursive version of insertion sort.
12. Implement recursive version of binary search.
13. Implement loop version of binary search.
14. Implement hybrid sorting algorithm of merge and insertion sort, that in cases when the array size gets smaller than the given k positive number, it directly sorts with insertion.
15. Implement bubble sort.
16. Swap 2 integers without a temporary.
17. Given an array of integers, write a program to output its maximum subarray indices. Write the brute-force version with O(n^2) complexity. 
18. Write problem17 with O(n) complexity.
19. Implement Min Heapify algorithm.
20. Implement iterative version of Max Heapify algorithm.
21. Write a bogomax() function that takes an array and returns the first element if it's the maximum, otherwise it finds the maximum by repeatedly swapping the first element with randomly selected one and re-checking.
22. Write a function that will find the middle node value in a singly linked list.
