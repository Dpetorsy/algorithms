  1 Write a program that calculates the square root of a number with Newton's method.
  2 Write a program to check if an integer is prime.
  3 Write a program to find the greatest common divisor of two integers by: 2.1 Prime factorization.
  4 Write a program to find the greatest common divisor of two integers by: Euclidean algorithm.
  5 Write a program that will calculate lowest common multiple of two integers by factorization.
  6 Implement insertion sort that will sort n integers in increasing order.
  7 Write a program that adds two n-bit binary numbers, stored in two arrays of size n. The some should be stored in an array of si    ze (n+1).
  8 2.1 Write a program that finds the maximum element in an array of size n. 2.1.3 Analyse the running time.
